# ColabC3D

ColabC3D is a collab notebook that provides some options to manipulate and visualize the C3D data that might include Motion capture data, Forceplate data, Analog data line EMG, ECG, etc. ColabC3D uses Google Colab, a cloud-based Python development environment, for processing and visualizing C3D files. By combining the power of C3DTools, Three.js, and Pygwalker, we provide researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts with a flexible and efficient platform to gain valuable insights from C3D files across diverse domains. We outline the setup process, including the installation of C3DTools, Three.js, and Pygwalker, within the Google Colab environment.
